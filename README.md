# Hospital Discharge Metrics Analysis

Analyzing NHS Kent and Medway Integrated Care Board (ICB) discharge metrics to understand patterns, delays, and system performance.

## Project Overview

This project investigates discharge-related metrics in NHS hospitals across England. It focuses on:

- Number and trends of daily hospital discharges  
- Identification of delayed discharges and bottlenecks  
- Exploration of metrics like average LOS (Length of Stay), discharge rates, and readmission rates  
- Comparison across trusts, regions, and over time

A deeper understanding of these metrics aims to inform hospital capacity planning and improving patient flow.

## Objectives

- Analyze historical discharge metrics (e.g., daily discharges, delayed discharges)  
- Visualize trends at national and sub-national levels  
- Identify potential pressure points and service demand  
- Support data-driven decision-making for NHS operational management

## Tools & Data Sources

- **Language:** Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, statsmodels)
- **Data Sources:** NHS England hospital discharge datasets, Trust-level summaries, ONS demographic context
- **Notebooks:** Written in Jupyter, covering data ingestion, cleaning, analysis, and visualization
